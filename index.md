# Profile

I am Andrew a computer science major from Canada. I have a passion for learning and love finding new skills. I thoroughly enjoy working with other motivated and inquisitive indivduals on a plethora of projects. I have a wide skill set outside of computer science. Through my work in the construction industry, schooling, and my plethora of hobbies I find many oppertunities to get involved with interesting projects. When I am relaxing I can be found wondering around my beloved home city or out in nature, and in good company. This site is just a little resume and portfolio to give a better look at who I am and what my skills are.
