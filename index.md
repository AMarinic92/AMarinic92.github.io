# Profile

I am Andrew a computer science major from Canada. I have a passion for learning and love finding new skills. I thoroughly enjoy working with other motivated and inquisitive individuals on a plethora of projects. I have a wide skill set outside of computer science. Through my work in the construction industry, schooling, and my plethora of hobbies I find many opportunities to get involved with interesting projects. When I am relaxing I can be found wandering around my beloved home city or out in nature, and good company. This site is just a little resume and portfolio to give a better look at who I am and what my skills are.
