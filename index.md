# Profile
I am Andrew, a full-stack application developer and computer science major from Canada.    
With a passion for learning and a love for acquiring new skills, I thrive in environments where I can collaborate with motivated and inquisitive individuals on a variety of projects. My skill set extends beyond computer science, shaped by my experiences in the construction industry, my academic background, and a diverse range of hobbies. These experiences give me the opportunity to get involved in a wide array of interesting, hands-on projects. When I’m not working, you’ll find me exploring my beloved home city or enjoying the outdoors with good company. This site serves as a resume and portfolio, offering a glimpse into who I am and the skills I bring to the table.
