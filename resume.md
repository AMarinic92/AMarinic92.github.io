# Projects
## Mantis
Android application  
January 2023 – April 2023  

A simple Android application designed for developers to track bugs. The group project was for a software engineering class. We utilized standard Android Java development with the Agile design methodology. I primarily held a leadership position with additional development roles with Junit testing and designing domain-specific objects to use across layers.

## Accessibility Checker
Chrome extension with distributive computing – Internet Archive  
January 2024 – April 2024  

A proof-of-concept project was designed alongside advice and consultation from the Internet Archives UI team leader. The concept was to explore the possibility of using machine learning to assess accessibility issues under WCAG 2.2 guidelines to achieve this we built a Chrome extension that sent tasks to a server with CUDA capabilities to provide machine learning-assisted assessments of certain aspects of the site. My primary roles were as team leader, implementation of machine learning, and implementing HTML parsing algorithms. The project back end relied heavily on pre-established Python libraries such as BS4, TensorFlow, and HF Transformers. The front end was a Chrome extension built quickly with Vite and utilized a unique SSH socket to communicate with our back-end server.[Accessibility Checker](https://github.com/AMarinic92/4560-IA-Accessibility-Checker)  

## Real Time Networks
University of Manitoba   
January 2024 – April 2024   

After completing a fourth-year Real-Time Systems class I was invited to take a topics project to investigate if it was reasonable to ask students taking the Real-Time Systems class to attempt new topics. The project was done on a SAM E51 Curiosity Nano development board and was all written in C and two other students were working independently on the project. We had successfully utilized the onboard debugger for sending back messages to OpenOCD which was something previously unutilized by the class. Then we were tasked with designing a CAN network driver. After this another student was to implement a Wi-Fi card peripheral while I was tasked with implementing a new UART driver for an RS485 peripheral. The project concluded with us making a rudimentary network that passed along peripheral information and utilized some additional drivers we had written, for instance, my I2C drivers. We managed to control peripherals via PWMing and I2C SERCOM on one board via a private UART network with custom messages to another which in turn was connected to another board via a CAN network, the last of which boards had a wifi card which we controlled via HTTP requests.
